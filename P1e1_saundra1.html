  At the same time, <br>
  these social networks tend to treat native t&nbspe&nbspx&nbspt and pictures; <br>
  — things that are directly posted to them — <br>
  with a lot more respect than those that reside on outside web pages. <br>
  One photographer friend explained to me how the images he uploads directly to Facebook receive a large number of likes, <br>
  which in turn means they appear more on other people’s news feeds. <br>
  On the other hand, when he posts a link to the same picture somewhere outside Facebook — <br>
  his now-dusty blog, for instance — <br>
  the images are much less visible to Facebook itself, <br>
  and therefore get far fewer likes. <br>
  The cycle reinforces itself.<br>
  Some networks, like Twitter, treat hyperlinks a little better. <br>
  Others, insecure social services, are far more paranoid. <br>
  Instagram — <br>
  owned by Facebook — <br>
  doesn’t allow its audiences to leave whatsoever. <br>
  You can put up a web address alongside your photos, <br>
  but it won’t go anywhere. <br>
  Lots of people start their daily online routine in these cul de sacs of social media, <br>
  and their journeys end there. <br>
  Many don’t even realize that they’re using the Internet’s infrastructure when they like an Instagram photograph or leave a comment on a friend’s Facebook video. <br>
  It’s just an app. <br>
  But hyperlinks aren’t just the skeleton of the web: <br>
  They are its eyes, a path to its soul. <br>
  And a blind webpage, <br>
  one without hyperlinks, <br>
  can’t look or gaze at another webpage <br>
  — and this has serious consequences for the dynamics of power on the web. <br>
  More or less, <br>
  all theorists have thought of gaze in relation to power, <br>
  and mostly in a negative sense: <br>
  the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a powerless object, <br>
  devoid of intelligence or agency. <br>
  But in the world of webpages, <br>
  gaze functions differently: <br>
  It is more empowering. <br>
  When a powerful website — <br>
  say Google <br>
  or Facebook — <br>
  gazes at, <br>
  or links to, <br>
  another webpage, <br>
  it doesn’t just connect it — <br>
  it brings it into existence; <br>
  gives it life. <br>
  Metaphorically, <br>
  without this empowering gaze, <br>
  your web page doesn’t breathe. <br>
  No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, <br>
  unless somebody is looking at it, <br>
  it is actually both dead and blind; <br>
  and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.

  On the other hand, <br>
  the most powerful web pages are those that have many eyes upon them. <br>
  Just like celebrities who draw a kind of power from the millions of human eyes gazing at them any given time, <br>
  web pages can capture and distribute their power through hyperlinks. <br>
  But apps like Instagram are blind — <br>
  or almost blind. <br>
  Their gaze goes nowhere except inwards, <br>
  reluctant to transfer any of their vast powers to others, <br>
  leading them into quiet deaths. <br>
  The consequence is that web pages outside social media are dying.
