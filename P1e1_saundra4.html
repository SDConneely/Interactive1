  At the same time, these social networks tend to treat native text and pictures- <br>
  things that are directly posted to them — with a lot more respect than those <br>
  that reside on outside web pages. One photographer friend explained to me <br>
  how the images he uploads directly to Facebook receive a large number of<br>
   likes, which in turn means they appear more on other people’s news <br>
   feeds.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
  On the other hand, when he posts a link to the same picture somewhere outside Facebook — <br>
  his now-dusty blog, for instance — the images are much less visible to Facebook <br>
  itself, and therefore get far fewer likes. The cycle reinforces itself.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Some networks, like Twitter, treat hyperlinks a little better. Others, insecure social services, <br>
  are far more paranoid. Instagram — owned by Facebook — doesn’t allow its audiences to leave <br>
  whatsoever. You can put up a web address alongside your photos, but it won’t go anywhere. <br>
  Lots of people start their daily online routine in these cul de sacs of social media, <br>
  and their journeys end there. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Many don’t even realize that they’re using the Internet’s infrastructure when they like an Instagram<br>
  photograph or leave a comment on a friend’s Facebook video. It’s just an app.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
  But hyperlinks aren’t just the skeleton of the web: <br>
  <br>
  They are its eyes, <br>
  a path to its soul. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  And a blind webpage, one without hyperlinks, can’t look or gaze at another webpage — <br>
  and this has serious consequences for the dynamics of power on the web.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  More or less, all theorists have thought of gaze in relation to power, and mostly in a <br>
  negative sense: the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a powerless object, <br>
  devoid of intelligence or agency. But in the world of webpages, gaze functions<br>
  differently: It is more empowering. When a powerful website — <br>
  <br>
  say Google or Facebook — <br>
  <br>
  gazes at, or links to, another webpage, it doesn’t just connect it — <br>
  it brings it into existence; gives it life. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Metaphorically, without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn’t breathe. No matter how many links <br>
  you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it, it is actually both dead and <br>
  blind; and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, the most powerful web pages are those that have many eyes upon them. <br>
  Just like celebrities who draw a kind of power from the millions of human eyes gazing<br>
  at them any given time, web pages can capture and distribute their power through <br>
  hyperlinks.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  But apps like Instagram are blind — or almost blind. Their gaze goes nowhere <br>
  except inwards, reluctant to transfer any of their vast powers to others, <br>
  leading them into quiet deaths. The consequence is that web pages outside <br>
  social media are <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  dying.
